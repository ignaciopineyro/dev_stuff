## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI technique that combines external knowledge sources with a large language model (LLM) to produce more accurate and relevant responses. Before generating an answer, the LLM first retrieves information from a specified knowledge base, such as an internal company database or a specific dataset, and then uses both this retrieved information and its own training data to formulate the final response. This allows LLMs to provide context-specific, up-to-date, and reliable answers without the need for constant retraining
